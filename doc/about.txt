Philosophy and Justification
----------------------------

The two biggest desktops today, GNOME and KDE, have become juggernauts going
into specific directions. GNOME strives for simplicity at the expense of
customization and underlying technology. KDE has the technological advantage,
but is pervaded by bad design. Both desktops have made questionable technical
choices - the use of DBUS for inter-client communication in lieu of an X-based
solution for instance. Today I doubt it is possible to make either desktop
approach design of their software much differently.

Tranquility shall strive for excellence in the following areas:

 o Design - simple, clean design. To facilitate this, all UI changes shall be
   reviewed thoroughly before inclusion in the upstream repository. Any flaws
   shall be fixed before such inclusion.
 o Technology - simple, clean design. Beware of over-engineered solutions. In
   general, always remember the YAGNI rule. All API is suspect to change,
   except if otherwise guaranteed in the documentation.
