All Tranquility software uses qmake as their build system. To build all the
available software out of tree, do the following:

 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ qmake ../tranquility.pro
 $ make

Some distributions choose to install qmake as qmake-qt4. Alternatively you can
build any single software using the same approach by pointing qmake at their
project (.pro) file. Building out of source in a separate build directory is
recommended.
